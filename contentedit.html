<!doctype html>

<p>
Enter a line of text, hit "return" twice, enter another line of text.<br><br>
Check the div's Basic&gt;Value in a11y inspector on mac. Or AXValue in chrome://accessibility. There should be 2 newline characters between the first and second line of text. On both chrome mac and chrome linux, there will be only one newline char. I didn't test windows.
<br><br>
Safari gets the number of newline characters between the lines correct.
